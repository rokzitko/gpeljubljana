Gross-Pitaevski equation solver (Mathematica)

## About
GPE Ljubljana is a simple Mathematica implementation of the split-step spectral method for solving the Gross-Pitaevski equation on a Cartesian discretization grid in 1D, 2D and 3D. Because Mathematica is using highly efficient FFT and inverse-FFT routines, the code is equally fast as compiled low-level language implementations, but much more flexible. The code was written in 2018 for theoretical support to experimental endeavours in the ultracool cold atoms lab in Ljubljana. It is inspired by this C++ GPE solver.
